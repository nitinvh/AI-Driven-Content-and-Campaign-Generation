# AI Driven Content and Campaign Generation Tool

## üìå Overview

The **AI Driven Content and Campaign Generation Tool** is an autonomous, multi-agent system designed to **create high-quality written content** and **generate targeted social media campaigns** with minimal human intervention.
It uses **Autogen** for orchestrating AI agents and **LangChain** for tool integration, with specialized agents working in a **round-robin workflow** to ensure quality and consistency.

The system supports:

* End-to-end **blog/article creation**
* Strategic **multi-platform social media promotion**
* **Human-in-the-loop approval** for final deliverables
